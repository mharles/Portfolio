            <p>The information that nobody tells you about in order to achieve dating and masculinity mastery is now grouped into a single place!
                
               You have been probably trying to read other books and consume all sorts of content regarding dating and masculinity. I know I had when I was a small boy, however I would never truly enhance my dating knowledge by listening to the internet. I felt so frustrated that I would actually blame the women because they wouldn't validate me.

But things have changed forever when I met two distinguished friends of mine.

They shared with me the pieces that I needed in order to finish the dating puzzle. Dating was no longer a problem for me ever since I was 16. All I had to do was to follow a simple guideline and repeat each time I saw a girl that I wanted. There was no need for gurus or hours spent watching YouTube videos.

Today I am passing to you the sole set of principles that you need to apply in order to be a dating expert. Everything you need is in this book. As long as you have a decent level of hygiene, girls will be an easy subject for you.

The principles I am about to share with you are no rocket-science. I won't teach you anything that you can't grasp.</p>
